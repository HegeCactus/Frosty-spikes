Done-Maps


Place ready maps here, mark down some info on what level of map they are, or suggest a slot/position.

Done maps by Hege Cactus:

MAP01.wad - Intended to be a first map or early map atleast. Will be before MAP02.wad regardless

Ma07Boned - Midway diffucult map, actual slot not yet specified, marked as 07 due of this being a recycled map from an old project
Map08darkDarkening - Midway diffucult map, contains secret exit to the map "Cyberdemon Sandwich", not actual slot, this is a recycled map aswell


WIP-Maps

Add your WIP maps here and put some info about the files themselves
Mention if you wish other folks to edit the said map

WIPS from Hege Cactus:

Cybiesandwich.wad - Secret map 

HellGateMultiplier.wad - Space styled hell dimension warp map, big and harsh map.

MAP02.wad  - Intended for after map01.wad in the done section, a city map, semi difficult.

MAP03.wad - Not actually intended for slot 3, no actual slot yet decided. Rustic space dimensional type of map

MAP03remake.wad - Old recycled map from an older project, not actual slot 3 again, it is a sunken castle base of rust

fearrun07.wad - Old map that was planned to be used for other project but never finished, 
this isnt once more planned for 07 slot specificly, this map is a corrupted artic base

map10intotheemadness.wad - once more, not actually slot 10. Hellish map, aimed to be difficult, near end map

castlemap.wad - exactly what it says on the tin.
