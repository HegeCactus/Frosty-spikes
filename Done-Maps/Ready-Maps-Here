Place ready maps here, mark down some info on what level of map they are, or suggest a slot/position.


MAP01.wad - Intended to be a first map or early map atleast. Will be before MAP02.wad regardless


Ma07Boned - Midway diffucult map, actual slot not yet specified, marked as 07 due of this being a recycled map from an old project
Map08darkDarkening - Midway diffucult map, contains secret exit to the map "Cyberdemon Sandwich", not actual slot, this is a recycled map aswell
